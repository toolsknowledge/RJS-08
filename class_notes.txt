Differences Between Angular Framework and React Library
--------------------------------------------------------

                            Angular                                         ReactJS

 1)   company               Google                                          Facebook

 2)   Version               Angular12                                       17.x

 3)   DOM                   Real DOM                                        Virtual DOM
                            (takes the less space)                          (takes the more space)

 4)  Performance            Less Performance Compared                       10.X more performance compared to Angular
                            ReactJS

 5) Language                TypeScript                                      1) JSX          2) TSX

 6) Data Binding            two way data binding                            one way data binding
                            (automatic data synchronization                 (when ever model updated then only view will be updated called as one way data binding)
                            between model and view in presence                  
                            of component called as two way
                            data binding)

Software Installation
---------------------

1) download and install NodeJS

    "NodeJS" containes following tools.

        1) node

        2) npm

        3) npx

    node tool, used to execute the JavaScript.

    npm stands for node packaging manager.

    npm tool helps to install the ReactJS, Angular12, VueJS,......

    npx stands for node packaging runner.

    npx creates the environment to create the react applications

website : https://nodejs.org/en/

file    : node-v16.1.0-x64.msi


2) install yarn tool

    yarn tool, provided by facebook.

    yarn tool, used to download the 3rd party libraries.

    yarn tool, Installation is command based Installation.


    > npm install -g yarn

    where "-g" stands for global installation


3) install create-react-app tool.

    create-react-app tool provided by facebook.

    create-react-app tool tool, used to create the react applications.

    create-react-app tool installation also command based installation.

    
    > npm install -g create-react-app


4) install visual studio code

    VSCode given by Microsoft.

    VSCode is the open source IDE.

    VSCode used to develop the React, Angular, VueJS, NodeJS,........


    website : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win

    file    : VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.56.2.exe



                                    ****** Steps to create the React Application ******


Step 1.
    create the react application

    > npx create-react-app first-app --template typescript

    where "first-app" is the name of the react application.


Step 2.
    switch to react application

    > cd first-app


Step 3.
    execute the react application

    > yarn start


    The Default port number of react application is 3000



Directory Structure of React Application
----------------------------------------

node_modules
------------
    - this Directory containes libraries.

    - these libraries helps to create and execute the react application.


public/favicon.ico
-------------------
    - this logo representing default logo of reactjs

public/index.html
-----------------
    - react starts the execution from "index.html" file.

    - index.html file called as main template.

    - main template containes "div" as DOM Element, whose id is "root"

    Ex.
        <div id="root"></div>

public/logo192.png
       logo512.png
------------------
    - above resolution images helps to execute the react applications in difference devices.

manifest.json
-------------
    used to configure the mobile application development.

public/robots.txt
-----------------
    used to define the conditional keywords related to react applications

src/App.tsx
    App.css
    App.test.tsx
-----------------
    "App" Component is the default component.

    "App.css" file is the style sheet for "App" Component.

    "App.test.tsx" file the unit test case file for App component.

src/index.css
-------------
    - used to define the global styles

src / index.tsx
----------------
    - in general we will deploy components in src Directory.

    - all components we must register in index.tsx file.

src/svg.logo
------------
    - this is the default svg logo of "reactjs".

    - svg stands for "scalar vector graphics".

    - svg used to draw the diagrams by using "XML".

    - svg images have "more clarity" compared to "Canvas".

src/react-app-env.d.ts
-----------------------
    - used to configure the application level configurations.    

src/setupTests.ts
------------------
    - privides the support to write unit test cases. 

package.json
------------
    - used to download the 3rd party libaries.

tsconfig.json
--------------
    - used to configure the typescript.

                                    ***** Components *****

        - Reusable portion of "complex UI" Called as Component.

        - As a React Developer, we can create more than "one" component.

        - As a React Developer, we can provide communication between one component to another component.

        - React provides two types of Components.

            1) Stateful Components    (Class Level Components)    (Latest)

            2) Stateless Components    (Functional Level Components)

        - state & props

        - component own data called as "state".

        - component receives the data from another component with the helps of "props".
